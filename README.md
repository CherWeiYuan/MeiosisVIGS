# Statistics for "Knock-down of gene expression throughout meiosis and pollen formation by virus-induced gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana"
Paper is published in the Plant Journal at https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.15733

# Contents
The paper consists of three main datasets. According to the subtitles in Methods:
1. Odds of obtaining viable seeds in Col-0 plants treated with TRV-FIGL1, TRV-RECQ4 and TRV-GUS (GLMM)
2. Rescue of semi-sterility of msh4 mutant lines
3. Pollen tetrad counts over time

Each dataset is filed into the Github repository folders with the same folder name as the Methods subtitles. 
The folders contain the dataset in csv format, R script with step-by-step analysis and rationale for each step, and the model validation plots (if the assumption of model used requires it). 

All models were built according to the two statistical protocols by Zuur and his colleagues:
